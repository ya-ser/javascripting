let total = 0
const limit = 10

console.log(total)

/*The challenge:  
   
  Create a file named for-loop.js.  
   
  In that file define a variable named total and make it equal the number 0.  
   
  Define a second variable named limit and make it equal the number 10.  
   
  Create a for loop with a variable i starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each  
  time through the loop. The loop should run as long as i is less than  
  limit.  
   
  On each iteration of the loop, add the number i to the total variable. To  
  do this, you can use this statement:  
   
     total += i  
   
  When this statement is used in a for loop, it can also be known as an  
  accumulator.  Think of it like a cash register's running total while each  
  item is scanned and added up.  For this challenge, you have 10 items and  
  they just happen to be increasing in price by 1 each item (with the first  
  item free!).  
   
  After the for loop, use console.log() to print the total variable to the  
  terminal.  
   
  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

Correct answer
let total = 0
const limit = 10
    
for (let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
  total += i
}

console.log(total)

for some reason, making "const total = 0" gives an error for the + in total += i
to fix that, you need to put "let total = 0" instead
not sure why
