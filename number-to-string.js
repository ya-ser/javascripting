let n = 128;
n = n.toString()
console.log(n)

/*The challenge:  
   
  Create a file named number-to-string.js.  
   
  In that file define a variable named n that references the number 128;  
   
  Call the .toString() method on the n variable.  
   
  Use console.log() to print the results of the .toString() method to the
